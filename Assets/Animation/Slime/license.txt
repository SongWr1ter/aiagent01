Unity Sprite Animation Settings
Automatic Center Delete Existing Slice
Unity does good job of adjusting all of it except height.
set h to 64 all of them then delete unneccesary ones like text and shadows selected as wrong.
y changes each line but same for same line.

Just drag and drop the slime folder to unity project.
